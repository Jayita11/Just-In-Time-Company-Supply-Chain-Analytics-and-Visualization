## Business Problems

1. **Shipment Delays**:  
   Delays in delivering products to customers are leading to dissatisfaction and lost revenue. These delays are most prominent in key regions such as Latin America and Africa, where logistical inefficiencies are more pronounced. The inability to meet on-time delivery expectations is straining customer relationships and reducing overall business efficiency.

2. **Inventory Management Issues**:  
   Overstocking and stockouts are frequent due to poor demand forecasting and uneven inventory distribution. Overstocking leads to higher storage costs, while stockouts result in missed sales opportunities and frustrated customers. The challenge lies in finding the right balance between ensuring product availability and minimizing excess inventory costs.

3. **Supply and Demand Imbalances**:  
   Certain product categories experience significant supply-demand mismatches. While some products face consistent demand, others struggle with high delays or low turnover rates, leading to either overstock or stockouts. This misalignment impacts both revenue and operational efficiency.

4. **Lack of Customer Segmentation Insights**:  
   The company lacks a detailed understanding of customer purchasing behaviors across different regions and product categories. Without these insights, it's difficult to make informed decisions about product promotion, inventory allocation, and targeted marketing strategies.

## Goals of the Analysis

1. **Reduce Shipment Delays**:  
   Analyze and identify the root causes of delivery delays, particularly in underperforming regions, and implement logistical improvements to ensure faster and more reliable deliveries.

2. **Optimize Inventory Levels**:  
   Implement strategies to better manage inventory by aligning stock levels with actual demand, reducing storage costs, and preventing stockouts.

3. **Balance Supply and Demand**:  
   Improve supply chain processes to address mismatches in supply and demand, ensuring that high-demand products are available in the right regions at the right time.

4. **Enhance Customer Insights**:  
   Use data analytics to gain deeper insights into customer behavior and purchasing trends. This will enable more targeted marketing efforts, better inventory planning, and a more personalized customer experience.

### Business Overview Dashboard

![Business Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75977b92-ea26-431d-a0e2-96a81b5afda8)


- **Profit by Warehouse Country (Pie Chart):** The USA contributes the most to profit generation, accounting for **61.49%**, while **Puerto Rico** generates **38.51%**. This suggests that although Puerto Rico is performing well, the USA remains the dominant contributor to profit margins, likely due to larger order volumes or higher efficiency in the supply chain.

- **Product Category by Highest Inventory Cost (Bar Chart):** **Cleats** lead in inventory cost at **$18.52K**, followed by **Women's Apparel** at **$14.41K**. This suggests that the Cleats and Women's Apparel categories require significant investment in inventory, and careful management of stock levels in these categories is critical to minimize holding costs and optimize profit margins.

- **Most Profitable Goods (Bubble Chart):** Products such as **O’Brien Men's** and **Pelican Sunstream** are the most profitable, with several other goods closely following. This emphasizes that a few key products drive profitability, and focusing on these top-selling items can help maintain overall profitability while possibly expanding the marketing of similar products.

- **Most Profitable Product Category (Horizontal Bar Chart):** **Fishing** is the most profitable category at **$1.15M**, followed by **Cleats** and **Camping & Hiking**. This highlights the significance of outdoor sports-related goods in driving profits. Increasing inventory and marketing efforts in these high-profit categories could further boost overall profitability.

- **Net Sales vs Profit Margin Trend (Line and Bar Chart):** The chart shows a stable upward trend in net sales from **2015 to 2017**, peaking in mid-2017, followed by a decline in **2018**. Profit margins, however, have remained fairly stable, with small fluctuations. This indicates a need to investigate why sales dropped in 2018, even though profit margins stayed relatively steady, to adjust business strategies accordingly.

- **Profit by Product Department (Treemap):** The **Fun Shop** department dominates in profit generation, with **$3.64M**, followed by **Apparel** and **Golf**. This suggests that departments related to sports and leisure are performing best. A deeper analysis of why these departments are excelling could help replicate their success across other departments like Footwear, which generates comparatively lower profits.



### Shipment Management Dashboard


![Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 11 13 37 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0deaf10-5417-4b74-a2e2-94c2bed0ba9e)



- **Shipment Status by Customer Market (Stacked Bar Chart):** **LATAM (Latin America)** and **Europe** have the highest number of shipments, with LATAM reaching **2,923 delayed** and **2,712 on-time deliveries**, followed by Europe with **2,507 delayed** and **2,712 on-time**. North America shows fewer shipments but a balanced distribution between delayed and on-time deliveries. This suggests focusing on improving shipment efficiency, particularly in high-volume regions like LATAM and Europe, where delays are prominent.

- **Highest Shipment Delay by Product Category (Bubble Chart):** **Cardio Equipment** has the highest average shipment delay at **5.014 days**, followed by **Indoor/Outdoor Games (3.630 days)**. Addressing these product categories to reduce delays will significantly impact overall delivery performance, as delays in high-demand items can harm customer satisfaction and business performance.

- **Shipment Delay by Product Name (Bar Chart):** **Nike Men’s Free 5.0 Run** has the highest shipment delay of **5.014 days**, followed by **O’Brien Men's Neoprene** with a delay of **3.630 days**. In contrast, some products, such as **Diamondback Women’s Series**, have negative delay values, indicating faster-than-expected delivery. This highlights the need to focus on improving logistics for specific products that consistently experience longer shipment delays.

- **Shipment Delay Trends Over Time (Line Chart):** Shipment delays show a declining trend from **2015 to 2018**. The average shipment delay has decreased from **50 days in 2015** to around **0 days by 2018**. This positive trend indicates improvements in the overall shipment process, though there may still be occasional spikes that need addressing. Ensuring that this downward trend continues will be crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction.

- **Shipment Mode by Distribution (Pie Chart):** **Standard Class** accounts for the majority of shipments at **58.46%**, followed by **Second Class** at **19.46%**, and **First Class** at **15.70%**. Same-day delivery only constitutes **6.39%** of total shipments. Increasing the use of faster shipment modes like **First Class** and **Same Day** could help reduce shipment delays, especially for high-priority or time-sensitive products.

- **Shipment Delay by Country (Map Visualization):** The map shows that certain countries, particularly in **Latin America** and **Africa**, experience higher shipment delays. The USA also has significant shipment delays, although to a lesser extent. Addressing logistical challenges in countries with higher delays through localized strategies or improved carrier partnerships could lead to a reduction in overall delays.



### Inventory Dashboard

- **Top 10 Product Name by Inventory Cost per Unit (Bar Chart):** The product with the highest inventory cost per unit is **Nike Men’s Dri-FIT Victory** at **$49.40**, followed by **Perfect Fitness Rip Deck** at **$47.93**. These products require significant financial investment to stock, so managing their inventory efficiently to avoid overstocking is crucial for minimizing holding costs.

- **Supply & Demand by Product Department (Bar Chart):** There is a slight imbalance in supply and demand across product departments. For instance, the **Fan Shop** department shows more demand (**19.67K**) than supply (**18.60K**), suggesting potential understock issues. On the other hand, the **Golf** department shows more supply than demand. This discrepancy calls for adjustments in supply chain strategies to balance demand and supply, preventing stockouts or overstock situations.

- **Product Category by Stock (Bar Chart):** **Cleats** have the highest stock (**1,529 units**), while **Cardio Equipment** has the lowest (**55 units**). This indicates that Cleats are well-stocked, but low inventory levels in categories like Cardio Equipment and Men's Footwear (**264 units**) may result in understock situations if demand increases unexpectedly. Monitoring these low-stock categories is essential to avoid potential fulfillment issues.

- **Understock Product Fulfillment Days (Bar Chart):** The chart highlights that products like **Nike Men's Free 5.0 Run** and **Under Armour Toddler Shoes** experience significant understock fulfillment delays of **4.90** and **5.50 days**, respectively.

Addressing the understock issues for these items will significantly reduce delivery delays and improve customer satisfaction.

- **Top 10 Product Name by Storage Cost (Treemap):** The **Perfect Fitness Rip Deck** has the highest storage cost at **$18,517.72**, followed by **O'Brien Men's Neoprene Life Vest** at **$11,989.78**. High storage costs indicate that these items may occupy significant warehouse space or incur higher holding costs. These products should be closely monitored to ensure their turnover is high, reducing the financial burden of storing them.

- **Inventory to Sales Delta (Bar Chart with Delta):** **Women's Apparel** and **Fishing** categories are experiencing the most severe understock issues, with significant negative deltas (**-180** and **-248**, respectively). On the other hand, **Cleats** show a positive delta of **169.6**, indicating overstock. Ensuring an optimal balance between inventory and sales for these categories will help maintain stock levels and minimize overstock or understock costs.

## Recommendations

- **Optimize Product Inventory**: To improve profits and reduce storage costs, inventory optimization is crucial, particularly for high-demand and high-margin products. By studying seasonal demand patterns and adjusting stock levels accordingly, the company can avoid overstock during slow periods and prevent stockouts during peak times. Maintaining a reasonable buffer for popular products will enhance customer satisfaction while minimizing excess inventory expenses.

- **Rebalance Inventory Distribution**: Distribution imbalances, especially in high-demand categories like Fan Shop, have resulted in missed opportunities. Reorganizing inventory distribution across warehouses, especially for fast-moving goods, can reduce shipment delays and improve overall service levels. By aligning warehouse stock levels with regional demand, the company can increase its responsiveness and reduce transit times.

- **Improve Shipment Efficiency**: Shipment delays are a recurring issue, particularly in regions like Latin America and Africa. By refining logistics and working closely with local carriers, the company can reduce delivery delays and improve on-time performance. Investing in faster shipping options, such as promoting Same Day or First Class modes, will further enhance delivery reliability for time-sensitive products.

- **Leverage High-Performing Products**: Products like Perfect Fitness Perfect Rip Deck and Field & Stream Sportsman 16 Gun Fire Safe consistently perform well across various KPIs. Ensuring consistent stock levels, increased marketing efforts, and strategic pricing can further capitalize on their profitability. Focusing marketing efforts on top-performing products during peak seasons will also maximize revenue potential.

- **Address Underperforming Categories**: Some product categories, such as Fishing and Men's Footwear, exhibit high shipment delays and operational inefficiencies. A closer evaluation of these categories to understand bottlenecks in production, shipment, or demand forecasting could help resolve issues. Innovative marketing and product improvements could also boost performance in these underperforming categories.

- **Reduce Shipment Delays for Bulky Products**: Large products like Pelican Sunstream 100 Kayak and Field & Stream Sportsman 16 Gun Fire Safe experience significant delays due to their size and logistical challenges. Focusing on improving the supply chain for bulky items, such as using specialized carriers or optimizing packaging, could streamline their delivery process and reduce delays.

- **Monitor Discounting Strategies**: Some products, such as Nike Men’s CJ Elite 2 TD Football Cleat, receive high discounts but show lower profit margins. A review of discount strategies is recommended to ensure they align with profitability goals. Adjusting pricing strategies for products with poor profit-to-discount ratios can ensure better financial returns without compromising sales volume.

- **Expand Market Penetration in Underperforming Regions**: Shipment data shows that regions such as Latin America and Africa have substantial sales potential but are affected by delays and logistical inefficiencies. Expanding partnerships with regional carriers and optimizing inventory levels at regional warehouses could improve penetration and performance in these regions.

- **Improve Marketing Strategies for Seasonal Products**: Seasonal products like Lawn Mowers and Summer Dresses perform well during specific periods. Aligning marketing strategies with these seasonal peaks by offering timely promotions, targeted advertising, and special discounts can help capture demand more effectively during these periods, maximizing sales potential.

- **Optimize Warehouse Storage Costs**: Products like Perfect Fitness Perfect Rip Deck and O'Brien Men's Neoprene Life Vest incur high storage costs. Conducting regular inventory reviews and reducing excess stock for these items during off-peak seasons will help lower storage expenses. Additionally, increasing turnover rates for high-storage-cost items can reduce the financial burden of long-term storage.
